            <p>2, We don’t do free shipping anywhere in India. All purchases are shipped from our own or third-party warehouses/ stores or offices from various points in India. 
            Our endeavour is to make the products reach you within 7-10 days from receipt of order and payment.
            Order deliveries will be made usually between 10.30 am – 7 pm Monday –Sunday.
            We do not offer a COD facility, and all deliveries are prepaid.</p>
            <p>3, We take no responsibility for goods signed by an alternative person other than the person ordering the product at the address indicated at the time of the order.
                Since the transactions are authorized by the cardholder, we do not take responsibility for incorrect 
                addresses provided at the time of placing the order. 
                The delivery will NOT be redirected/redelivered to any other 
                address in any circumstance.</p>   
            <p>4, Our products are packaged in secure packaging. If you find that the package is tampered with, please do not accept delivery of the same from the carrier.

            <p>5, Products ordered in one cart will be shipped to one shipping address. 
                For requirements in which the products need to be shipped to separate addresses, 
                separate orders need to be placed via separate carts.</p>     
            <p>6, Loss or theft from date & point of dispatch to date & point of delivery gets lost. 
                But on the off chance that the shipping label comes off,
                or the package is torn and the contents scattered, 
                you’ll have no choice but to file a lost package claim with the carrier.</p>
