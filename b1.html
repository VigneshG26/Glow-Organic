        Here’s a fun fact for you – not everything that tastes good is good for you. Yes, that’s right, we often indulge in unhealthy food without even realising we are doing so. Avoiding certain foods can help you lead a healthy life. Here are the 5 foods that you must try to avoid at all costs.
        <br><br>
        <b>Sugar</b><br><br>
        We consume sugar in various forms in our everyday lives. In our coffee/tea, aerated drinks, juices, sweets, etc. The fact is, sugar contains high amounts of calories and no additional nutrients. Sugar can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Reduce the intake of chocolates, candies, soft drinks, etc...
        <br>
        You can try replacing sugar with organic jaggery or even consume fruits and vegetables that have natural sugar present in them. This will help reduce your sugar intake.
        <br><br>
        <b>Breakfast cereals</b><br><br>
        Breakfast cereals are made from processed grains such as wheat, oats, rice, and corn.Breakfast cereals are often roasted, shredded, pulped, rolled, or flaked in sugar to make them more palatable.
        <br>
        Try avoiding breakfast cereals as much as possible and have nutritious breakfast substitutes like organic poha, ragi, or even wheat dalia. These products are high in nutritional value and in taste too.
        <br><br>
        <b>Junk food </b><br><br>
        This is one list of food items we all are aware of how unhealthy they can be, but relish them equally. Pizzas, burgers, french fries are on everyone’s minds, but must not be in their diet. They provide you with plenty of calories which will automatically lead to weight gain, resulting in obesity. Junk food is said to be the leading cause for obesity around the world
        <br>
        While you can enjoy these tasty treats once a while, it’s best to add dals, pulses, sprouts, and other essential nutritionally dense foods to your diet.
        <br><br>
        <b>Fried, grilled or broiled food </b><br><br>
        More than the food here, it is how the food you eat is prepared. Frying, grilling, and broiling are among the unhealthiest cooking methods. Foods cooked in these ways contain several types of unhealthy chemical compounds as they are cooked under high heat
        <br>
        You can choose to boil, stew, blanch or steam your meal, or you can even try switching to organic to ensure all the nutrients are present and you enjoy a wholesome, healthy meal.
        <br><br>
        <b>Processed food</b><br><br>
        The simplest way to eat healthy and lose weight is to avoid processed foods as much as possible. Processed foods contain GMO and other chemicals which are bad for your health. The use of preservatives, sugar and salts is very high in these foods.
        Switching to organic food is one way to reduce the intake of such foods.
        <br>
        So, the next time you go shopping, look out for organic food, or simply click here to explore our organic range of food, and choose to eat healthier.
